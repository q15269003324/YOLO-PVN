YOLO-PVN: Lightweight and Efficient Traffic Sign Detection for Real-Time Autonomous Systems
The Visual Computer


Code:
You can get the official YOLO-PVN code at https://github.com/q15269003324/YOLO-PVN ,get the pruning code at https://github.com/jaeho-lee/layer-adaptive-sparsity, get knowledge distillation code at https://github.com/drilistbox/CWD and then add our improvement code to the project.

Before pruning, the split block in the C2f_PMS module needs to be converted to an equivalent double Conv block.


Data:
The TT100K dataset is available at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LjipnZrPexyVvA53n7t0mw?pwd=q123
